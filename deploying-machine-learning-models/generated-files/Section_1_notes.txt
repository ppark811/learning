##### Deployment of Machine Learning Models #####

What is Model Deployment?
- Model deployment is the process for making models available in production environments, where they can provide predictions to other software systems.
- It is one of the last stages of an ML lifecycle, potentially one of the most challenging

Why is it challenging?
- Challenges: Reliability, reusability, maintainability, flexibility, and reproducability (<- this last one is specific to ML)
- Needs coordination from data scientists, IT teams, sw devs, stakeholders, and busines professionals.
- Often a discrepancy btw programming language it was developed in and the production system language. Recoding is a risk
- To start using ML model, it needs to be effectively deployed
